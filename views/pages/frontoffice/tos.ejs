  <ol>
    <li>
      <h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>By using <%= client.user.displayName %>, you agree to comply with and be bound by these Terms of Service. If
        you do
        not agree, do not use the application.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Description of Service</h2>
      <p><%= client.user.displayName %> is a Discord bot that learns from messages sent by users in the Discord
        server. It
        collects message content data from channels it has access to and uses that data to train a lightweight Markov
        chain for text generation. Users have commands to manage the data <%= client.user.displayName %> learns and
        must
        use the /train command to let <%= client.user.displayName %> fetch all messages in the server. By default,
        <%= client.user.displayName %> only saves messages from channels it has access and permissions to.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Data Collection</h2>
      <p><%= client.user.displayName %> collects message content data but does not collect user data or timestamps.
        <%= client.user.displayName %> saves media URLs, including images, GIFs, and videos, even NSFW ones.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>User Responsibilities</h2>
      <p>You are responsible for ensuring <%= client.user.displayName %> has the correct permissions to access
        channels. You
        agree not to misuse <%= client.user.displayName %> or use it for any illegal activities.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Prohibited Conduct</h2>
      <p>No spamming, phishing, or other malicious activities. No harassment, hate speech, or any other behavior that
        is
        harmful or offensive. Do not use bots or automated scripts to interact with <%= client.user.displayName %>
        inappropriately.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Open Source and Usage</h2>
      <p><%= client.user.displayName %>'s code is open source, and there are no restrictions on how people use it. We
        encourage free and open use.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Termination</h2>
      <p>We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your access to the application at any time, without notice, for
        conduct that we believe violates these Terms of Service or is otherwise harmful to others.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p><%= client.user.displayName %> is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. We are not liable for any
        direct,
        indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, including but not limited to damages for
        loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Amendments</h2>
      <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms of Service at any time. Any changes will be effective immediately
        upon
        posting. Your continued use of the application constitutes your acceptance of the modified terms.</p>
