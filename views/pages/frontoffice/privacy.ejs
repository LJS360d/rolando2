      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Welcome to the <%= client.user.displayName %> Privacy Policy. Your privacy is important to us. This policy
        explains what
        information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding that information.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <p><%= client.user.displayName %> collects message content data from the Discord channels it has access to.
        We do not collect any personal user data, such as usernames or timestamps. We also save media URLs, including
        images, GIFs, and videos, even NSFW ones.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>How We Use Collected Information</h2>
      <p>The collected message content data is used to train a lightweight Markov chain for text generation tied to the
        server.
        The media URLs are stored for the bot's operational purposes. We do not share this data with third
        parties.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
      <p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect the data collected by <%= client.user.displayName %>.
        However, no
        method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee
        its absolute security.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>User Controls and Data Deletion</h2>
      <p>Users can manage what data <%= client.user.displayName %> learns via commands. By using the /train command,
        users
        allow <%= client.user.displayName %> to fetch messages. Users can also request the deletion of collected data
        by
        contacting the owner <b>zlejon</b> on discord through the <a class="text-blue-500"
          href="https://discord.gg/tyrj7wte5b">official Discord server</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p><%= client.user.displayName %> is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13. We do not
        knowingly collect
        personal data from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected such data, we will
        delete it.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of any changes by posting
        the new Privacy Policy on this page. Your continued use of <%= client.user.displayName %> after any changes
        constitutes your acceptance of the new terms.</p>
    </li>
