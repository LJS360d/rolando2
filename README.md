Discord Bot implementation of a MarkovChain to learn how to type like a user of the guild.  
Currently hosted on: [berrybyte](https://berrybyte.net/)<br>
Created with: [Fonzi2 framework](https://github.com/LJS360d/fonzi2)

## Overview

Rolando is a Discord bot that leverages Markov Chains to mimic the speech patterns of users within the server. The bot guesses the next word in a sentence based on the patterns it has learned.


## Credits

The concept is inspired by [`Fioriktos`](https://github.com/FiorixF1/fioriktos-bot), a Telegram bot using similar principles.
